In JavaScript, the execution context is the environment where code is evaluated and executed. It holds details about variables, objects, functions, and the value of `this` for the current scope. The process begins with the creation of the global execution context, and each time a function is called, a new execution context is created. JavaScript organizes these contexts using a call stack, with the most recent context on top. Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase, which sets up the scope, hoists variables and functions, and determines the value of `this`; and the execution phase, where the code runs line by line. When a function completes, its execution context is removed from the stack, and control returns to the previous context. This system allows JavaScript to manage scopes, access variables, and control the order in which functions are executed.
