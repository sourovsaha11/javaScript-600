/*

The difference between export and import is below there,
suppose we have a lot of hilsha fish in our country , and we want to sell it to other countries. Then we can export hilsha fish to other countries. And other countries can import hilsha fish from us. So, in this case, we are the exporter and other countries are the importers. In programming, export and import are used to share code between different files or modules. Exporting is like selling hilsha fish to other countries, and importing is like buying hilsha fish from us. So, in programming, we can export functions, variables, or classes from one file and import them into another file to use them. This helps us to organize our code better and make it more reusable.
